# ECMAScript-2019-New-Features-V-
This is the code repository for [ECMAScript 2019 New Features [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/ecmascript-2019-new-features-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
The Technical Committee No. 39 (TC39) every year releases a new version of ECMAScript with new and cutting edge features. Languages like Javascript are based on the ECMAScript standard. ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages.

As a developer, it is important to stay at the forefront and embrace these features early. This video course helps you write better code that is efficient, performant and devoid of workarounds. In an effort to write efficient code, developers often resort to third party libraries that offer a ready to implement solution, built using features available in older versions of JavaScript. This often results in bloated code, which can be easily avoided by embracing features that are native to JavaScript, following the latest releases of the language. 

By the end of the course, you will be familiar with all the latest features from both ECMAScript 2018 and 2019 standards. You will be able to embrace these features quickly as you work through the hands-on examples in the course.
